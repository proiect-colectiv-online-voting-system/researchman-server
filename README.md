# ResearchMan Server

The server-side part of the ResearchMan application.

# How to run

1. Clone the repository
2. Install **node.js 12.14** if you haven't already
3. Install the **yarn** package manager
`npm i -g yarn`
4. From the folder where you cloned the repo run `yarn install` to install the dependencies. This can take a while.
5. Run `yarn strapi build` to build the admin dashboard UI for the backend.
6. Start the server by running `yarn strapi develop`.
7. Follow the instructions in the terminal to create an admin account.

At this point the back-end should be ready to use. To set up the front end see the https://github.com/proiect-colectiv-online-voting-system/researchman-client
